            <li>1 & 1/2 cup soy sauce</li>
            <li> 3/4 cup sake</li>
            <li>3/4 cup mirin</li>
            <li>2 Eggs</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>

        <ol>
            <li>Soak the pork bones in cold water for 30 minutes to an hour</li>
            <li>Discard the water, bring a pot of new water to a boil, and blanche the pork bones for 5-7 mintues</li>
            <li>Drain and discard the water</li>
            <li>Thoroughly wash each neck bone, and place into pot boiling water over high heat</li>
            <li>Add each fragrance vegetable
                - Sliced Ginger
                - Leek chopped in half and cleaned
                - 2 bulbs of garlic cut in half
                - Dried kombu or kelp. Be sure to remove any excess white stuff
                - 1 & 1/2 tbsp. of chicken powder</li>
            <li>Skim off excess material that accumulates at the top. Be sure not to stir the soup as the scum could sink back to the bottom</li>
            <li>Afterwards, cover the pot, reduce to low heat, and simmer the broth for 3 hours</li>
            <li>Now, place your pork shoulder or belly into the pot, and simmer for 30 - 45 minutes</li>
            <li>In a separate pot will be the tare
                - Mix together Ginger
                - 3/4 cup sake
                - 3/4 cup mirin
                - 1 & 1/2 cup soy sauce</li>
            <li>Bring the tare to a boil over high heat for 5-7 minutes</li>
            <li>Once both the pork shoulder/belly and tare are ready, spread the tare sparingly over the meat</li>
            <li>Afterwards, cool the pork in a refrigerator </li>
            <li>Drain out the ramen broth into a bowl. It’s up to you whether you’d like to save or throw away the rest of the bones and fragrance vegetables. 
                - Decide how much ramen you are going to serve, and keep an appropriate amount of broth simmering over the stove</li>
            <li>Take out the pork. You may cut to your desire. Spread the tare over each cut tenderly and sparingly. We just want to bring out a little color in the pork.</li>
            <li>Bring out another bowl, fill it with water, and bring to a boil</li>
            <li>Take your noodles, and prepare them according to the instructions on the bag. Be mindful of how soft or firm you want your noodles</li>
            <li>In a ramen bowl, add:
                - 1/4 to 1/3 cup tare (depending on how salty you’d like it)
                - 1-2 cups of broth, I usually just eyeball this</li>
            <li>Add your noodles</li>
            <li>Add your garnish: egg, green onions</li>
            <li>Enjoy!</li>
        </ol>
