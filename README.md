Currently, this repository is from GitHub as part of an assignment from the Odin Project.

The process for making this project was enjoyable, and very quick. I was able to grasp the lessons quite well, and get to practicing to the skills I was taught, such
as writing in html, creating repositories and linking GitHub repositiories to my computer. I practiced making commits, and communicating good commit messages. I navigated 
through the command shell of unix, managing all the files related tot his project with specific commands. On top of that, I made a basic, funcitoning website that lists 
some of my favorite recipes. Over all, this was very fun.
